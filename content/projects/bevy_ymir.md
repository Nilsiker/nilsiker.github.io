[bevy_ymir](https://github.com/nilsiker/bevy_ymir) is a plugin for generating and streaming procedural worlds in Bevy.


![](/img/ymir-early-world-cropped.png)

The ambition is to provide a customizable world generator, with support for different biomes and various methods for procedural object placement.

Keep in mind that Ymir is in very early development. Expect hard-to-use APIs that break constantly!
