[**Contour**](https://github.com/nilsiker/contour) is a pixel-art horror microgame built using Aseprite, BeepBox and Bevy.

Contour is my solo-dev submission to Bevy Jam #2. Having just started playing around in Bevy, I am happy to present this simple horror scenario, inspired by The Last Door and Alan Wake. I'm looking forward to further develop and build on the foundation I've made for this microgame.
