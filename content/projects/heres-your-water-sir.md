_A game about drinking water and keeping it calm._


[**Here's your water, sir**](https://github.com/nilsiker/heres-your-water-sir) is a pixel-art horror minigame built using Godot, Aseprite and Audacity.

The game was created for the [Pixel Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/-pixel-game-jam-2024/rate/2718348).

Contour is my solo-dev submission to the Pixel Game Jam 2024. Using Godot and constraining myself to using only its scripting language GDScript, I created this short experience where an entity wants you to drink water for unknown reasons.

I consider this to be my first complete game, of course respecting its jam-sized scope.
