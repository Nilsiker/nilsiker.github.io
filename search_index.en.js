Despite this I’ve always loved telling stories and weaving narratives. Historically, this has been around the table with my friends playing tabletop games.\nAs a gaming group, we’ve been through our fair share of systems. Each one providing new takes on how to create and shape narratives. Some systems are lean and depend more heavily on the group’s improvisational skills (Fate), while others provide more rigid frameworks that ushers the characters and stories in directions based on multiple moving parts and subsystems (Burning Wheel).\n\nI’ve always been a fan of the more procedural systems. The same goes for my love for video games - despite it being a rough genre to like, I often prefer the unplanned and chaotic nature of survival games over games pushing you along a curated story.\nThere’s great beauty to be had in the drama created by independent game systems synergizing in unpredictable ways. You need but cast a quick glance at Dwarf Fortress patch notes to assure yourself of it.\n\nA world generated\nSo, what’s up with this long-ass preamble? The points I’m making form a line that points toward my first major undertaking on my Rust developer journey - Ymir.\nYmir is a very early and rigid implementation of a terrain generator plugin with a dummy system providing makeshift object placement. All in all, the performance is shoddy and the API is close to useless. It suffices as a proof of concept - nothing else. But boy, am I optimistic!\n\n\nWhat’s next?\nI really want to dig into it and talk about the specifics - inspirations, planned features, implementation details and technical unknowns - the whole nine yards!\nDespite its infancy, some draft systems are in place. The landscape mesh generation is passable in its current state, but provides little-to-no information about the landscapes once generated. All it offers currently is a colored terrain with an attached collider. It’s cool, but hardly useful.\nI want to make my next post about exploring the current implementation, discuss how it can be improved, and provide some code-along examples where I actually implement the improvements.\nFor now, I will leave you with this short code snippet, illustrating a very high-level and barely customized usage of the plugin to serve as an example.\nTo the seasoned Bevy enjoyer, it is a trivial code block.\nTo Ymir, it’s a peek of things to come.\n\nThanks for reading!

This is how we learn!\n\n🙋🏼 If you simply want a functioning FSM for your Godot project, I suggest heading over to the Godot Asset Library and searching for available FSM plugins. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, unless you want to!\n\n\nScope\nAt the end of this post, we will end up with a state machine that controls a simple Mover system that pushes a RigidBody3D around.\n\n\n    stateDiagram\n    direction LR\n    Player--&gt;StateMachine: has a\n    Player--&gt;Mover: has a\n    Mover--&gt;Player: moves\n    StateMachine--&gt;Mover: controls\n\nThe FSM will support two states that we can transition between - idle and walking.\n\n\n    stateDiagram\nIdle--&gt;Walking: Pressing WASD\nWalking--&gt;Idle: Not pressing WASD\n\nIn future posts, we will iterate on the module, improving the design and architecture making it more generic and more loosely coupled – so stick around! 🙂\n\nProject setup\nBefore diving into the code, we head on over to Godot and set up some WASD mappings for movement. We’ll call the actions up, down, left and right:\n\nNext, we setup a scene (let’s call it main.tscn):\nAdd a RigidBody3D to the scene and call it Player. Then, add some visuals and a collider as children nodes. I’m using a capsule shape for both.\nWith the rigidbody selected, go to Axis Lock and check Linear Y, Angular X and Angular Z. This way the Player will ignore gravity and won’t topple over.\nIn addition to this, set Linear &gt; Damp to something like 5. This will prevent us from sliding around like crazy!\nFinally, add a Camera3D and position it reasonably so it looks slightly down at the world origin. Your scene will look a little like this:\n\nNow that we’re all set up, let’s get codin’!\n\nDefining a State\nWe decide that our states should be able to handle logic that executes:\n\nUpon entering the state\nDuring idle processing – Node._Process(double)\nDuring physics processing – Node._PhysicsProcess(double)\nUpon exiting the state\n\nWith this in mind, we sketch up a class that looks like this:\n\n\n    classDiagram\n    class State {\n        Enter() void\n        Tick(double) void\n        PhysicsTick(double) void\n        Exit() void\n    }\n\n\n🙋🏼 We will notice this definition changes throughout the series. For now, let’s continue!\n\n\nAbstract State\nNext we create an abstract State class with this definition in our project. I’ll just plop it down right in a scripts folder for now.\n\nWe won’t be inheriting from Node, but instead make this a pure C# class. We will also have it perform some basic logging in each method. \nReplace all contents of State.cs with the following:\n\n\nIdleState\nIn addition to this abstract State, let’s create two concrete states - the IdleState and the WalkingState. Both inherit from State and, for now, does nothing except call the virtual methods on the base class, for now.\nCreate both scripts and put them in the scripts folder.\n\n\nWalkingState\nFor the WalkingState, we will leave a TODO in the PhysicsTick function:\n\nFantastic! We now have two states ready for use. To actually use them, we need to create the actual SM of our FSM.\nEnter, the state machine!\n\nThe State Machine\nTo enable our character to use our states, we need a controller of sorts to track and handle what state we are in and transitions to other states.\n\nCreating the machine\nIn its most simple form, a state machine is a state container that can call the state functions and change what state we are in. To make it clearly visible in the scene hierarchy, let’s make it inherit from Node.\nLet’s sketch one up!\n\n\n    classDiagram\n    direction LR\n    StateMachine o-- State \n    Node&lt;|--StateMachine\n    class StateMachine {\n        - ChangeState(State) void\n    }\n\nSimilarly, we create a StateMachine.cs script and dunk it straight into our scripts folder. The story goes:\n\nWe keep a list of all possible States in the machine and create them in the _Ready function.\nWe decide on a default state for the machine and set it in the _Ready function.\nWe keep track of the current state.\nWe’ll call the Tick and PhysicsTick state functions in _Process and _PhysicsProcess respectively.\nChangeState handles calling the exit and enter logic on the states we transition between.\n\nIt looks something like this:\n\n\n🙋🏼 For now, let’s keep the concrete states public - this will trick us into a circular dependency very soon, but we’ll break that up in a later part of this series!\n\nOur FileSystem should look like this, at this point:\n\nNext we’ll take our State Machine for a logging spin!\n\nTesting the machine\nAdd the StateMachine node anywhere in your scene. Hitting play should yield some logs:\n\nWhile not particularly exciting, we are successfully idling! If you’ve come this far, take a short break and grab your drink of choice before continuing. Well done! ☕\nNext, we’ll be tackling transitioning to other states!\n\nState Transitions\nWe have states and we have a machine - all we need now is transitions between the states. It will take a little refactoring, so buckle up!\n\nSetting up our states and machine for transitioning\nThe conditions that decide if we should switch to another state will live inside our states. One way to change our state is to let our states call the ChangeState function on our machine. Let’s do that for now!\nRemember that circular dependency I warned about earlier? Don’t blink, because it’s happening now.\nWe will introduce a StateMachine reference in our states. It will sit snugly in the abstract State class like so and be assigned in the constructor:\n\n\n🙋🏼 While it’s not pretty, it does the trick for now. I promise you we’ll sort this circular dependency atrocity out in the future!\n\nLastly, we update our concrete state constructors to pass the StateMachine down the base constructor. We also update our state constructions in StateMachine.cs:\n\n\n\nAnd with that, we have all the plumbing to perform state transitions! We are nearly there…\n\nImplementing transition conditions\nWe need to determine when to switch between the Idle and Walking states. For this, we tell IdleState that if we’re moving with WASD, we should transition to walking. \nIn Tick we poll for our transition condition like so:\n\nIn WalkingState, if we’re not pressing WASD, we transition to IdleState.\n\nAt this point we have two states, a state machine and conditions in the states describing when to switch between the states.\n\nA simple Mover system\nWe will showcase our FSM using a really basic Mover:\n\nAdd the Mover node to the Player node, and assign the Player as the rigidbody in the Inspector. If you haven’t already, this is also the time to add the StateMachine to your Player.\n\nNext, add a public export reference to the Mover in our machine so that we can access it from our WalkingState. \nDon’t forget to assign the Mover in the Inspector afterwards!\n\n\n🙋🏼 In a future post, we will improve the way we get the systems that are used in our states. At this point, it doesn’t have to be perfect!\n\nFinally, update the WalkingState to perform some movement in PhysicsTick:\n\nJust like that, we’re ready for the big reveal.\n\nThe final result\nWith no fear in your heart, press F5 in Godot and take her for a spin!\n\nThere we have it – a functional FSM framework! This can be used to control all possible aspects of a character, if we put some more love into it.\nGive yourself a compliment or two, you’ve earned it! 👏🏼\nExperiment and play around with the FSM – add some states, a new system, or try to break the circular dependency yourself. \nHave fun with it! ☀️\nIn the next part, I will show you how I solve the circular dependency. We will also improve the way we fetch systems in our states.\nAll the best,\nNilsiker\nsource code here\npart 2 &gt;\n","id":"https://nilsiker.github.io/blog/finite-state-machine-1/","title":"Godot Recipe: Finite State Machine #1"},"https://nilsiker.github.io/blog/finite-state-machine-2/":{"body":"&lt; part 1\n\n⚠️ This post assumes you have a basic understanding of Nodes and Scenes in Godot and some familiarity with C# syntax if you plan to code along!\n\nLast time, we left things in quite a mess.\nA class overview of our current FSM looks like this:\n\n\n    classDiagram\ndirection TB\n    class StateMachine {\n        + ChangeState(State) void\n    }\n    class State {\n        - _name : string\n        + Enter() void\n        + Tick(double) void\n        + PhysicsTick(double) void\n        + Exit() void\n    }\n    StateMachine --|&gt; Node\n    State --&gt; StateMachine\n    StateMachine --&gt; WalkingState\n    StateMachine --&gt; IdleState\n    StateMachine --&gt; State\n    StateMachine --&gt; Mover\n    &lt;&lt;abstract&gt;&gt; State\n    WalkingState --|&gt; State\n    IdleState --|&gt; State\n    Mover --&gt; RigidBody3D\n    namespace Godot {\n        class RigidBody3D\n        class Node\n    }\n\nIt might not look too bad at this point. If I recall, our demo showcase proved that our basic movement system worked! So why should we bother reworking it?\nOnce we start adding more systems, more states and (cue foreshadowing) a way for our states to handle external events, this setup will swiftly become a breeding ground for logical errors and hard-to-maintain code.\nMy pain points at the moment are:\n\nWe’re not using any organizational tools to categorize our classes\nState and StateMachine form a circular dependency\nStates need to access other states through the StateMachine\nWalkingState need to access Mover through the StateMachine\nOverall, classes are too dependent on concrete classes (tight coupling)\n\nLet’s make a plan to solve this and prevent future headaches!\n\n⚠️ The tips and techniques shown below are workflows and structures I’ve found works well for me. There might be more idiomatic ways to achieve modularity and encapsulation in Godot.\n\n\nScope\nThe goal for this post is to utilize the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) to kill off our circular dependency and make our code more loosely coupled. We will briefly touch on the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) and what it means for our code examples.\nWe will also be introducing a Locator pattern to improve how states get a hold of systems and other states.\nIn addition to this, we’ll organize or classes into namespaces to give our codebase some well-needed structure. \nWe’ll also honour the Interface Segregation Principle, but after that we put a LID on SOLID for now (sorry not sorry).\nWe’ll end up with something that looks like this:\n\n\n    graph\n    subgraph FSM\n        State--implements--&gt;IState\n        State--has--&gt;ISystemLocator\n        State--has--&gt;IStateLocator\n        subgraph Control2[Control]\n            State\n            IdleState\n            WalkingState\n            StateMachine\n            IdleState--inherits--&gt;State\n            WalkingState--inherits--&gt;State\n        end\n        StateMachine--has--&gt;IState\n        StateMachine--implements--&gt;IStateLocator\n        StateMachine--implements--&gt;ISystemLocator\n    end\n    subgraph Motion\n        subgraph Control\n        Mover\n        end\n        IMover\n        Mover--implements--&gt;IMover\n    end\n    WalkingState--has--&gt;IMover\n    Mover--has--&gt;RigidBody3D\n    StateMachine--inherits--&gt;Node\n    subgraph Godot\n        Node\n        RigidBody3D\n    end\n\n\n🙋🏼 Not a class diagram, I know – Mermaid doesn’t support nested namespaces in class diagrams yet, but subgraphs in flowcharts kinda does the trick.\n\nWe’ve got some refactoring to do, let’s go!\n\nUsing namespaces for organization\nI like my classes to belong to a well-defined module. To help me enforce this, I use C# namespaces.\nI follow a convention where the root namespace is the name of my project, let’s say Project. Publically available interfaces live in a nested namespace called the same as the module, let’s say Project.FSM. Classes that perform logic that is internal to the module live in yet another nested namespace in that module, let’s say Project.FSM.Control for logic. \n\n🙋🏼 If we want to separate logic and data, I would also introduce the namespace Project.FSM.Models or Project.FSM.Data – a Model-View-Controller approach!\n\nAll classes are updated to use this convention. The class-namespace mapping looks like this currently:\n\nProject.FSM.Control\n\nState\nIdleState\nWalkingState\nStateMachine\n\n\nProject.Motion.Control\n\nMover\n\n\n\nOptionally, you can mimic the namespace structure in the project folder structure. I always do this.\n\nFollowing this namespace convention, it shows that all our classes are Control classes and shouldn’t be exposed publically. We’ll sort this out by introducing interfaces as we go along.\n\nSolving circular dependencies using DIP\nDIP stipulates the following:\n\nA high-level class mustn’t depend on a lower-level class\nAbstract classes and interfaces should not depend on concrete classes\nConcrete classes should depend on abstract classes and interfaces\n\nIts goal is to create a more robust and maintainable solution. How does this relate to our current code?\nIn our current setup, the state is a lower-level class and the machine is a higher-level class. States should not need to know anything about state machines - not even that they exist. In turn, state machines should not care about state details - they should only depend on an abstraction of states.\nHow do we achieve this? It might come off as a bit esoteric, but it’s not that weird in practice!\n\nAdding Locator and IState interfaces\nThe states do not need the state machine itself. What they do need is a way to access systems, so they can control aspects of the character controller. They also need to relay WHEN to transition to another state, and WHAT state to transition to.\nThe way I tackle this, is that I introduce two interfaces: ISystemLocator and IStateLocator in Project.FSM and have StateMachine implement them. The goal here is to keep the fetching of systems and states as generic as possible.\nI also introduce an IState interface in Project.FSM, so that our IStateLocator can depend on an interface rather than an abstract class. Similarly, all references to states in StateMachine can instead reference the IState interface\n\nAs a matter of fact, we can fully generalize the Locator pattern. I’ll make one general Locator, and one generic one where you can specify constraints. I’ll put them in a namespace called Project.Core. Both ways are viable. This generic one might be a bit overengineered, but I’ll use it for now!\n\n\n⚠️ This ILocator definition is left out of the class overview at the top of this post. They made the diagram very hard to follow.\n\nThe abstract State is updated to implement IState. Concrete State classes are updated to store references to ILocator and ILocator&lt;IState&gt; instead of StateMachine.\n\nShifting state-changing responsibility to StateMachine\nI lied, the LID is officially off as we leverage the Single Responsibility Principle (S).\n\n🙋🏼 You could say it SLID off.\n\nThe responsibility to call ChangeState is shifted from State to StateMachine. Since the new interfaces don’t expose the ChangeState function, we instead return the result of ILocator&lt;IState&gt;.Get&lt;T&gt;() to the StateMachine where it can handle state-changing internally. The IState interface is updated to return IState on our tick functions for usual condition checks.\nIn doing so, StateMachine.ChangeState(State) can be made private. 💡\nYou could also add an IState return type to Enter if you feel like it, for really early state change guards. I won’t for now!\n\nThe StateMachine class is updated to implement the  Locator interface as shown below. I decide to keep the states inside the StateMachine using a list.\nFor now, I decide to have all systems under a Node called Systems. We export this and assign it in the Inspector.\n\n\n🙋🏼 Using OfType&lt;T&gt; from LINQ might not be the optimal way to do state and systems fetching. However, I find it very ergonomic as it allows me to work strictly with types in the state logic. If you have another neat way to solve this, I’d love to hear about it!\n\nGiven these changes, we have to move around and refactor our states a bit.\nAs an example, WalkingState ends up looking like this after the changes:\n\nThe StateMachine is updated to handle potentially returned states from the tick functions:\n\nFinally, make sure the scene structure is updated to respect that systems are expected to be children of the Systems node:\n\nHitting play should show that the StateMachine works just as before.\n\n🙋🏼 I admit it’s a lot of work for no new functionality, but it should help us do better design choices moving forward and provide us a framework on how to organize our systems.\n\n\nA brief comment on Liskov substitution\nThis principle states that you should be able to substitue an object with a sub-object without anything breaking.\nBy introducing IState and continue using our StateMachine as if nothing changed, we assume (🚩) that our code passes the Liskov substitution test. The machine should accept any object implementing IState and still work as expected. It seems to hold true for IdleState and WalkingState, but we should be wary as our module grows with increasingly complex interactions.\nThe same goes for systems – next let’s do some abstractions for our Mover!\n\nLoose coupling for systems\nWe loosened up our coupling by introducing the IState interface. We can do one better and let Mover implement the IMover interface:\n\nThe states can now also be updated to save references for the systems they need. On construction, WalkingState locates and stores the reference to the IMover.\n\nAs shown above, states only need to locate and store the systems as they are constructed.\nTherefore, we can do away with the persistent ILocator reference in the abstract State class.\n\nNow this is neat!\n\nTrying out our new architecture\nIf your folder structure is a reflection of the namespaces, our scripts folder should look rather tidy now.\n\nWith this new setup, what does it look like to add a new system? I’ll add a contrived system that changes the Player color and decide that the Player turns blue while idling and red while walking.\nThe folder structure would hade this added to it:\n\nAnd this code would be added:\n\n\n\nSimilarly, I locate the Appearance system in WalkingState, and change the color to red – et voilà!\n\n\nEnd result\nI’ve rambled a lot about software design, which can quickly become dull. If you’ve made it this far – great job!\nHow did we fare? Did all this nonsense actually solve anything? Let’s address my introductory pain points:\nProblemPlanSolved\nPoor code organizationIntroduce namespaces✅\nCircular dependencyInverting dependency using interface✅\nTight coupling for states fetching statesUse Locator pattern for states✅\nTight coupling for states fetching systemsUse Locator pattern for systems✅\nTightly coupled classesDepend on interfaces, Liskov substitution in mind✅\n\nOur states no longer expect concrete implementation to solve our needs.\nThey simply ask for a reference to any object that fulfills a specific contract – the interface.\n\n🙋🏼 A real neat thing is that we can track dependencies by gauging the using statements in our classes. If we see any Control class use another module’s Control namespace, that’s a red flag now and we’re probably missing an interface.\n\nNext post, we will take a look at event-handling support in states. This way, polling conditions in ticks won’t be the only way to trigger logic or state transitions in our FSM!\nIf you’re feeling curious, try your hand at setting it up yourself! ☀️\nAll the best,\nNilsiker\nsource code here\n","id":"https://nilsiker.github.io/blog/finite-state-machine-2/","title":"Godot Recipe: Finite State Machine #2"},"https://nilsiker.github.io/blog/using-rust-in-minimal-container-images/":{"body":"\n⚠️ This post wouldn’t exist without Björn Molins rust-minimal-docker repository.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn my professional work, I’ve developed a minimal Rust runner job to perform miscellaneous clean-up jobs based on messages from an event bus, all hosted in a cloud environment. \nThanks to the performance Rust provides and the virtually weightless scratch image, cloud compute and storage costs are so low they’re negligible.\nUsing a small web application as an example, I’ll go through a quick and concise project showing how to get started!\n\n🙋🏼 This is a bit of an outlier - I won’t be shoehorning any gamedev into this one. This is a quick post about a minimal Rust containerization example!\n\n\nScope\nFor this small project I’ll be using Podman to setup a containerized web application running on a scratch container image. It is a great open-source alternative to Docker.\nFor the application I will be using the web framework Rocket. It will include an index route, and an API route containing a singular endpoint for us to try out.\n\nThe Rocket application\nLet’s quickly outline how we code and configure the Rocket web application. This project uses Rocket version 0.5.\n\nCode\nRocket provides a concise API to get started with web applications. The entire code is contained in main.rs.\n\nIt’s a small application that returns a string message when accessing the base URL. It also provides a hello endpoint in its API route, that responds based on the name and optional occupation provided as query parameters.\n\n🙋🏼 I have yet to experiment seriously with Rocket, but it’s remarkable how little code you actually need to get started. It reminds me of Express.js – except I get to write Rust, making me a happy developer!\n\n\nConfiguration\nIn Rocket, we can create a file called Rocket.toml to configure our application. In our case we want to bind the application to the 0.0.0.0, so that we can curl our way into the container. The TOML looks like this:\n\nOf course, there is more configuration available to us. The official guide has a good section about Configuration.\nThat’s all regarding the application. Let’s look at creating the container image.\n\nContainerizing the application\nRunning the application locally with cargo run tells me the code is sound, but we want to run this in a container, ready to be deployed to any suitable platform or host.\nLet’s quickly set up a configuration for all this.\n\nSetting up our Containerfile\nFirst off, I create a Containerfile in my project root. The Containerfile specifies the following:\n\nNo bells and whistles, in short we:\n\nUse the clux/muslrust image as our builder\nCopy over necessary project files\nBuild the project in release mode, targetting x86_64-unknown-linux-musl\nUse the scratch image as our final image, our runner!\nCopy the compiled executable and the Rocket configuration file to the runner\nSpecify our app as the image entrypoint\n\nThat should be enough to get us running Rust in a barebones image. Next, we leverage Podman to build and run our container image!\n\nBuilding the image\nIf you are familiar with Docker, you’ll feel right at home. To build the image, we simply run:\n\nThe clux/muslrust image includes the necessary toolchain and libraries to compile for our target image scratch.\n\nRunning the image\nRunning the image is a breeze also. We run the image in a container using:\n\nWe use the detach flag -d to run the container in the background. \nUsing the publish flag -p we export the port 8080 inside the container to port 8000 outside the container.\nThis will allow us to curl the application running in the container, using the port 8000.\n\nTesting some curls\nWe’re probably all set now. To be sure, we try out our routes and API and see what we get.\n\nIt works flawlessly!\nOnce content with the responses, we can kill the container with podman kill &lt;ID&gt;.\n\nResult\nWith the sanity check above performed, we can confirm that the scratch image is running our application without problems. Mission accomplished!\nFor the grand reveal, we check our image size with podman images (some headings are omitted from the output):\n\nAdmittedly, the application is a very minimal example of a Rocket web application, but a basic web server application containing everything it needs to run as a standalone binary clocking in under 10MB? That is impressive!\n\n🙋🏼 If you want to go all crazy about it, you can add the option strip = true to your Cargo.toml release profile. At the time of writing this, this brought my image size down to a miniscule 4.35 MB!\n\n\nConclusion\nBasing your container images on scratch can be useful for hyperoptimizing disk space used - an image size under 10MB is quite the feat in my book!\nIn the case of Rust, where we can statically link our application into a standalone binary, we can successfully and also quite effortlessly provide a minimal environment for our application to run using scratch.\nFor smaller use cases, we might also enjoy the complete control over dependencies used. Since we are fully aware of the binaries and libraries used on the image, you could also make a case for a more conscious and clear picture of what security concerns our app and environment is susceptible to.\nI see a great use case for scratch-based images for small runner jobs or simple microservices where the use case isn’t very complex - a great argument to use the least bloated image available.\nOf course, the image does not come without its limitations. Imagine the observability issue; what if the container fails to run, and we want insights into what might be causing the problem. Since our standalone binary is possibly the only binary present in the container, how would we go about SSHing into the container?\nStripping out everything leaves us with not only full control but also full responsibility for what we put in our image.\nAt some point, it is more reasonable to use an Alpine Linux image. They’re not much bigger, and comes with a lot of handy tools that make your containerization endeavours easier. \nBut if all you want is a tiny data footprint, you can’t beat doing it FROM scratch.\nThanks for reading,Nilsiker\n","id":"https://nilsiker.github.io/blog/using-rust-in-minimal-container-images/","title":"Using Rust in Minimal Container Images"},"https://nilsiker.github.io/blog/vardag-devlog-1/":{"body":"You wake up to your 12 AM alarm kindly reminding you that you’ve booked the midnight laundry slot.\nThe buzz of fluorescent lights is heard overhead as you flip the switch to light your way to the basement laundry room.\nYou get the feeling something is not right.
